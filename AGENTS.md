# scenario-globe-viewer Agent Rules

Vite-based globe scenario viewer. This file is loaded by both Claude Code and
Codex CLI; `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file.

## 1. Scope

1. Project specifics (live state, decisions, scoped rules) are tracked in
   `.agent-memory/` (symlink into Claude Code's user-private memory store for
   this repo).
2. Cross-project workflow conventions (Multi-Tool Agent Convention, Memory
   Bridge Convention, Heavy-Compute Routing) live at
   `/home/u24/papers/AGENTS.md` §7 / §8 / §9.
3. Audit history is captured in `INDEPENDENT-AUDIT-*.md` at repo root; treat
   those as historical evidence, not active TODO.

## 2. Agent Memory Bridge

This repo bridges its agent memory across tools (Claude Code, Codex CLI,
future agents). The live, session-updated memory store lives at
`.agent-memory/` (symlink into Claude Code's user-private memory dir for this
repo's slug; the symlink itself is in `.gitignore`, the target is the source
of truth).

**Read order at session start (any agent):**

1. `.agent-memory/MEMORY.md` — index of all current memory entries for this
   repo.
2. Open every `.agent-memory/feedback_*` and `.agent-memory/project_*` entry
   whose description matches the task at hand.
3. Then proceed to the workspace-level workflow rules at
   `/home/u24/papers/AGENTS.md` §7 (Multi-Tool Agent Convention) and §8
   (Memory Bridge Convention).
4. Finally this repo's own rules below.

**Updating memory:**

- Only the Claude controller agent updates memory entries (writes to the
  symlink target). Codex CLI and other sub-agents treat `.agent-memory/` as
  read-only context.
- Memory entries that contradict current code or status are stale — surface
  the contradiction; do not act on stale memory.

The canonical bridge implementation reference is
`modqn-paper-reproduction/AGENTS.md` §Agent Memory Bridge.

## 3. Workspace Inheritance

This repo inherits the following from `/home/u24/papers/AGENTS.md`:

1. §7 Multi-Tool Agent Convention — controller (Claude Opus) / executor
   (Codex CLI or Claude sub-agent) / reviewer roles. Memory writes only by
   controller.
2. §8 Memory Bridge Convention — `.agent-memory/` is the source of truth;
   `AGENTS.md` carries a maintained snapshot for agents that can't load the
   memory dir.
3. §9 Heavy-Compute Routing — pilots and training (none expected for this
   visualization repo) route to the Ubuntu server `sat@120.126.151.102 -p
   2222`.

If a workspace rule conflicts with a project-specific rule, the project rule
wins for project-scoped tasks (per the workspace AGENTS.md scope split).

## 4. Project-Specific Pointers

Read order for new work, beyond the bridge above:

1. `.agent-memory/MEMORY.md` — live project state and scope rules.
2. `README.md` — repo entry point.
3. `docs/` — technical documentation.
4. `INDEPENDENT-AUDIT-final-report.md` + `INDEPENDENT-AUDIT-results.md` +
   `INDEPENDENT-AUDIT-requirements.md` — audit history, treat as forensics.
5. `src/` + `tests/` for implementation context.
6. `vite.config.ts` + `package.json` for build / dev-server setup.

## 5. Project-Specific Rules (snapshot from memory)

Critical rules embedded verbatim from `.agent-memory/` so a non-Claude
executor that fails to load the memory dir still sees them. The memory
entries are the live form; this section is a snapshot maintained alongside
them.

### R1. No ITRI references in new code (`.agent-memory/feedback_no_itri_in_new_code.md`)

ITRI-specific code paths, identifiers, and assumptions are legacy. New code
must not introduce new ITRI references. Existing ITRI-tagged code may stay
until a refactor explicitly removes it. If a task requires touching
ITRI-tagged code, surface the contradiction and confirm scope.

### R2. Visible-first dev (`.agent-memory/feedback_visible_first_dev.md`)

For UI / visualization changes, prefer making the change visible in the dev
server before extending tests or refactoring. Visual confirmation precedes
code structure decisions.

### R3. Caveman mode default (`.agent-memory/feedback_caveman_mode_default.md`)

Communication style for this repo defaults to caveman-compressed; switch to
normal mode only when the user requests it explicitly or when the task
requires multi-step safety prose.

### R4. Multi-station selector — development state snapshot (2026-05-17)

**Completed and committed to `main`:**
- Collapsible filter panel (`src/features/multi-station-selector/marker-filter-panel.ts`):
  `aside.gs-filter-panel` at `top:3.6rem; right:0.5rem` below Cesium toolbar.
  Header row 1 = "Ground Stations" label; row 2 = vis toggle + "Filters▾".
  Body: Orbit + Region (2-col grid) + Band chips, each group in `gs-filter-group` with label.
- Band filter (`marker-band-chips.ts`): Ka/Ku/C/X/S/L, gold `#ffd166` accent.
  `setBandFilter`/`getBandFilter` + `allowedBands` predicate in `station-markers.ts`.
- Station markers: **BillboardCollection** + canvas circles + `HeightReference.CLAMP_TO_GROUND`.
  Tri-orbit r=4.5px green `#7ee2b8`; dual-orbit r=3.5px blue `#9bc4e8`.
  `findNearestVisible(windowPosition: Cartesian2, tolerancePx: number): string | null`
  added to `GroundStationMarkersHandle` — screen-space proximity fallback for clicking.
- `station-info-card.ts` pick: `scene.pick()` → fallback `markers.findNearestVisible(pos,22)`.
  Hemisphere check: `dot(worldPos, cameraPos) > R²×0.85`.
- `composition.ts`: single mount `mountMarkerFilterPanel`. `marker-toggle.ts` on disk, not imported.
- Filter logic: orbit ∧ region ∧ band (AND across, OR within). Search removed from UI.

**Unresolved: edge station pick still unreliable.**
Some stations at the globe limb still unclickable. Root cause: `scene.pick()` depth-fails;
proximity fallback with 22px + dot>R²×0.85 still misses some. Suggested fix:
make proximity search the primary path (not fallback), snap-to-nearest within 30px always,
use `scene.pick()` only to confirm. Removes depth dependency entirely.

**Pending blocks:**
- **Block B — A11y**: focus trap on info-card open, global ESC, ARIA labels,
  `aria-live` on selection store, keyboard nav for station list.
- **Block D — Hover detail**: show orbit class badges + band chips in
  `marker-hover-tooltip.ts` (currently shows name+operator only).
- **Block A — V4 compute** (high risk, deferred): replace fixture-driven compute
  in `m8a-v4-ground-station-handover-scene-controller.ts:~6444` with
  `computeRuntimeProjection` from `runtime-projection.ts`.

(Memory entries in `.agent-memory/` are authoritative; this snapshot may lag.)

### R5. Canonical ITRI requirement list (`.agent-memory/reference_itri_canonical_requirements.md` snapshot)

Authoritative requirement source-of-truth lives at
`/home/u24/papers/itri/requirements-consolidated.md` (34 rows: A=19 main
axis, B=7 needs-ITRI-data-with-Tier-B-substitute, C=8 ITRI-infra). Cite
requirements by consolidated ID (`R1-F1`, `K-A4`, `V-MO1`); cite standards
with section (`ITU-R P.618-14 §2.2.1.1`, `3GPP TR 38.811 §6.7`). Do NOT
open `r1.docx` / `kickoff.pptx` directly. The 2026-05-17 B/C relabel
swapped previous B and C semantics — current alphabetical order = demo
priority order (A → B project Tier-B work → C ITRI infra last).

### R6. Concurrent-session collision caution (`.agent-memory/feedback_concurrent_session_collision.md` snapshot)

Multiple Claude / Codex sessions may edit this repo concurrently. Before
reverting any unexpected working-tree change, check: (a) file mtimes
(fresh = a live writer is editing), (b) `pgrep -af "claude --resume"` and
`pgrep -af "codex exec"` for parallel processes, (c) whether the change
forms a coherent feature unrelated to your task (that points to
concurrent work, not drift).

**Known parallel-WIP territory (as of 2026-05-17):** the
multi-station-selector marker-UI consolidation feature spans
`src/features/multi-station-selector/marker-*.ts`,
`src/features/multi-station-selector/station-markers.ts`,
`src/runtime/bootstrap/composition.ts`, and `src/styles.css`. Treat those
files as another session's WIP — read OK, write/revert FORBIDDEN unless
the task explicitly targets them. Always use specific `git add <path>`;
NEVER `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git commit -am` in this repo
(would sweep parallel-session files into your commit).

### R7. Multi-station-selector scope + 3-tier source authority (`.agent-memory/project_multi_station_selector_scope.md` snapshot)

The multi-station selector + V4 ground-station side panel is
**beyond-ITRI procurement scope** (user-personal product vision). Three
source-authority tiers used throughout the V4 demo:

- **Tier 1 operator-validated** — legacy Taiwan CHT + Singapore Speedcast
  pair via existing fixture
  `public/fixtures/ground-station-projections/m8a-v4.6b-taiwan-cht-speedcast-singapore-...json`. Do not touch.
- **Tier 2 public-disclosed** — both stations from the 69-station public
  registry AND share same `operatorFamily`. Label
  "Public-disclosure pair · operator-stated capability".
- **Tier 3 geometric-derived** — cross-operator pair, visibility-derived
  only. Label "Geometric pair · visibility-derived only".

Replay defaults: real-time window = wall-clock UTC `[now, now+20m]`;
playback multiplier 1x..120x is orthogonal to window selection. Shared
default handover policy is `cross-orbit-live` (V-MO1).

### R8. 3GPP / ITU citation map (`.agent-memory/reference_3gpp_itu_local_sources.md` snapshot)

12 standards PDFs delivered at `deliverable/3gpp-itu-references/` (its
README maps each PDF → cited section → requirement ID). Source PDFs +
converted markdowns live at `paper-catalog/3gpp/` +
`paper-catalog/markitdown-3gpp-pilot/markdown/`. Each
`src/runtime/link-budget/*.ts` module carries its §-citation header
(`free-space-path-loss.ts` → TR 38.811 §6.6.2, `rain-attenuation.ts` →
P.618-14 §2.2.1 + P.838-3 via delegation, `gas-absorption.ts` →
P.676-13 Annex 2, `antenna-pattern.ts` → S.1528 + S.465-6,
`handover-policy.ts` → TR 38.821 §7.3 + V-MO1). P.838-3 coefficient
table is delegated to pre-existing
`src/features/itu-r-physics/itu-r-p838-rain-attenuation.ts` (single
source of truth for the table); do not duplicate it.

### R9. Demo route URL + 5 candidate scenarios

Short URL form (2026-05-17, recommended): `/?stationA=<id>&stationB=<id>`
— both station ids must be valid registry entries; the implicit V4
activation auto-applies `scenePreset=regional` and mounts the V4 panel.
Implementation seam: `isM8aV4GroundStationRuntimeRequested` in
`src/runtime/m8a-v4-ground-station-handover-scene-controller.ts:~877`
and `resolveBootstrapScenePreset` in `src/runtime/bootstrap/composition.ts:~165`.
Long URL form
`/?scenePreset=regional&m8aV4GroundStationScene=1&stationA=...&stationB=...`
remains supported.

The 5 candidate demo URLs covering high/low elevation × rain/clear ×
handover/no-handover live at `docs/itri-requirement-walkthrough.md` §3
(Bucket B irreducible-2 substitute).

### R10. 62-req independent audit state — forensics (`.agent-memory/project_itri_audit_state.md` snapshot)

`INDEPENDENT-AUDIT-*.md` at repo root uses a **different framework** from
`requirements-consolidated.md` — 62 rows (F-XX / V-XX / P-XX / D-XX) with
verified/partial/cannot-verify status. 32/62 verified-complete as of
2026-05-16 (24-hour soak passed). **Audit verification requires retained
artefact + executed command + customer evidence**; do not self-promote
rows without that chain. The 2026-05-17 compute-layer additions are
recorded as a status-non-altering addendum at
`/home/u24/papers/itri/itri-acceptance-report-2026-04-20/2026-05-17-post-compute-layer-addendum.md`.
Treat all `INDEPENDENT-AUDIT-*` files as historical evidence, not active TODO.

## 6. Sync Rule

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. When editing, both Claude Code and
Codex CLI read the same content. No mirror maintenance needed.
